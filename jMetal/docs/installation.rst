Installation
============
jMetal is a Maven project hosted in GitHub, so there are two ways of getting the software: getting the source code from https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal or adding it as a dependence in your own Maven project. The sub-projects of jMetal can be obtained from the Maven Central Repository (https://search.maven.org/search?q=jmetal) or from MvnRepository (https://mvnrepository.com/search?q=jmetal).

The software requirements to use jMetal are:

* Java 13+ JDK 
* Maven
* Optional: R, Latex.

To work with the last development version, just clone the repository in https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal.
